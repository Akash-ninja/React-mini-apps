Typical React app -

1. Get the user's email and password from a login form and 
    check with an API endpoint whether password is correct.

2. If the creds are correct then we redirect the user to our main application 
    and save the user object in our state.

3. Protect the app from unauthorized access

Fake authentication -

1. Not gonna ask user credentials from an API but instead we're going to have a hard coded
    user object inside a state (context).
